# Support-Vector-Machine
python code in Jupyter notebook for species classification on Iris data Set using support vector machine (SVM).

1. Split the data set into train and test with ratio 8:2.
2. Compute test classification accuracy using SVM with following kernels: Linear, Polynomial
(degree 3), RBF (gamma = 0.5), and Sigmoid.
3. Visualize the performance of test accuracy on above kernels.
4. In RBF, Visualize the comparative analysis on gamma= 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9.
